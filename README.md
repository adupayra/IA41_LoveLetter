# IA41_LoveLetter

Project made in 3rd year of engineering school in IA course. 

The purpose of this project was mainly to implement a working AI to the game. We implemented an alpha beta algorithm, which was far from being the best option for this game. We also wanted to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm in order to have a better AI, however we ran out of time. We also implemented a GUI to the game using the MVC pattern.

Here is a screenshot of the game :
